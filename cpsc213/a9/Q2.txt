aRead is substantially faster than sRead in all three cases,
especially when reading a large number of blocks, while sRead
is linearly growing aRead consistently takes around 0.05 seconds
to run regardless of block size. This is because aRead is reading
the blocks in parallel rather than one after the other like sRead.
which means that it does not need to wait for one block to finish
reading before it starts the next one.
