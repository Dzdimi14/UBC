- statically allocates s, i and a
- load -10, to check if i - 10 = 0
- if i-10 != 0, s += a[i], i++
- basically s = sum of all of a values

S5a loop unrolled
- each step of the loop manually written out
- i is not statically allocated

S6 if
- set b to negative to compare if a-b > 0
- if it is, branch to then, else continue to else then branch to end
