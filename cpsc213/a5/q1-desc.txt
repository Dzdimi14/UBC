	The number of reads is 8 because in the C file, when the 
first line of void() runs, memory is read 4 times. Once to read a
because it's a pointer, then to read x which is also a pointer,
i is then read, and then x[i] is read.
	In the second line of void(), memory is read once for y[i]. 
b does not need to be read because it is statically allocated
when a is created.
	The third line of void() has 3 reads: once to read b.a 
because a is a pointer in struct b, once to find a->x, and
lastly to determine x[i].
	The last two lines do not require reading memory because we
have already previously accessed them.

The number of writes equals the number of store instructions 
which corresponds to lines 13, 24, 36,
42, and 54 in the assembly code.
